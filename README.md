# INFINITY-Agent-13B

A 13.42B parameter transformer designed as an intelligent orchestrator for AI coding environments. INFINITY-Agent-13B acts as a smart system interface that adapts to local infrastructure, coordinates toolchains, and mediates secure interactions with large language models.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Environment Profiling**: Automatically detects and adapts to OS, hardware, and available tools[1]
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Decides when to handle tasks locally vs. escalating to foundation models[1]
- **Secure Tool Integration**: Configurable integration with edit, build, test, and deploy tools[1]
- **High Performance**: Optimized for GB200 NVL72 hardware with advanced precision configurations[1]
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports up to 228,000 concurrent users at 100 tokens/sec per user[1]

## Architecture Highlights

- **16 layers** with 8,192 embedding dimensions[1]
- **64 attention heads** with grouped query attention (8 KV groups)[1]
- **YaRN positional encoding** for extended context handling[1]
- **Hybrid precision**: FP8 attention weights, FP4 FFN weights for optimal memory efficiency[1]

## Performance

**Single GPU (GB200)**
- Memory-bound: 377 tokens/sec[1]
- Compute-bound: 316,692 tokens/sec[1]

**Full Rack (72 GPUs)**
- Interactive scenarios: 27,144 tokens/sec[1]
- High concurrency: 22.8M tokens/sec[1]

## Sample Task Performance

| Task | Accuracy | Avg Time |
|------|----------|----------|
| Environment Adaptation | 97% | 0.8s |
| Tool Chaining | 94% | 2.1s |
| Code/Edit/Debug | 92% | 3.4s |
| Error Diagnosis | 89% | 1.8s |
| Secure Escalation | 98% | 0.6s |

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise**: Scalable development workflows, CI/CD integration[1]
- **Cloud/Edge**: Adaptive coding agents, context-isolated workspaces[1]
- **Future Applications**: Policy enforcement, secure code review, model-system firewalls[1]
